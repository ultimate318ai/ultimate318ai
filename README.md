# About me 

Graduated from the [Higher School Of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Of Grenoble](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en/),
I am currently improving myself in *Quality Assurance* in IOT web applications (python & robot framework). In my free time, I try to learn Svelte with typescript in order to have knowledge of both webapp development and N to N testing notions.

# Main Languages I use:

 - Python
 - RobotFramework
 - Latex
 - Svelte
 - Typescript
 - basic notions of Javascript
 - Html/CSS
 - Some rest of Java and C
