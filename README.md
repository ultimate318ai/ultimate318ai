Graduated from the [Higher School Of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Of Grenoble](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en/),
I am currently improving myself in *Quality Assurance* in IOT web applications (python & robot framework). I also try to learn JS and TS tools in order to 
have knowledge of webapp development and N to N testing notions.
