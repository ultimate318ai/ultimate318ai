Quality Assurance Engineer - FrontEnd Developper

# About me 

Graduated from the [Higher School Of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Of Grenoble](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en/),
I am currently improving myself in *Quality Assurance* in IOT web applications (python & robot framework) and front end developement. 

I really have developped a quite significant interest over *Git* and *typing principles* over differents programming languages.

I don't really have chosen my side between *testing* and *developping* ones and I deeply think that those are not mutually exclusives.

I mainly have developped and tested webApplication and I want to improve my field of expertise for **web** developpement.

# Main Languages I use:

 - Python
 - RobotFramework
 - Latex
 - Angular
 - Typescript
 - Notions of Javascript
 - Html/CSS
 - Some rest of Java and C
 - SQL and MongoDb
